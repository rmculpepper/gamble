@title[#:tag "features"]{Probabilistic Features}

The probabilistic features of this language consist of @tech[#:key
"erp"]{elementary random procedures (ERPs)}, a memoizer, and a set of
sampler/solvers.

At a high level, every ERP when called produces a value from an
associated probability distribution. The precise behavior of an ERP,
however, depends on the sampler/solver context it is executed
under. In a @racket[mh-sampler] context, for example, an ERP might
reuse a choice from a previous run, subject to random
perturbations. In an @racket[enumerate] context, an ERP will fork
its context and potentially the consequences of all values in its
distribution.

@defproc[(sample [dist dist?]) any]{

Returns a sample from @racket[dist]. The @racket[sample] procedure
cooperates with the enclosing sampler/solver, unlike
@racket[dist-sample].
}

@defproc[(fail [reason any/c #f]) any]{

Used to express condition failure. When used within a sampler or
solver, it typically causes the sampler/solver to try again with a
different set of choices.

For example, the following function models two coin flips where at
least one of them is known to be heads (@racket[#t]):

@racketblock[
(define (flip-two-coins/one-heads)
  (define A (flip))
  (define B (flip))
  (unless (or A B) (fail))
  (list A B))
]
}

@defproc[(observe-at [dist dist?] [value any/c])
         void?]{

Represents observing the value of a random variable distributed as
@racket[dist] being @racket[value]. Typically, the effect is to adjust
the likelihood of the current sampler/solver execution.
}

@defproc[(mem [f procedure?])
         procedure?]{

Returns a memoized version of @racket[f].

In general, a memoized function must not be called outside of the
dynamic extent of the sampler/solver context in which it was
created. See @seclink["nesting"] for more discussion.

(define f (mem (lambda (n) (bernoulli))))
